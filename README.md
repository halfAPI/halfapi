# halfAPI

This Python-based ASGI application aims to provide the core functionality to
multiple API domains.

It's developed at the [LIRMM](https://lirmm.fr) in Montpellier, France.

The name "halfAPI" comes from the deep relationship between it and
[halfORM](https://gite.lirmm.fr/newsi/halfORM), a project authored by 
[JoÃ«l Maizi](https://gite.lirmm.fr/maizi).
