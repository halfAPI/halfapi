# HalfAPI


This Python-based ASGI application aims to provide the core functionality to
multiple API domains.

It's developed at the [LIRMM](https://lirmm.fr) in Montpellier, France.

The name "halfAPI" comes from the deep relationship between it and
[halfORM](https://gite.lirmm.fr/newsi/halfORM), a project authored by
[JoÃ«l Maizi](https://gite.lirmm.fr/maizi).

You'll need a database with the API details. You can find the database model in halfapi/models/api.sql

**TODO :** include a token generation tool for testing purpose.

```
cp conf/systemd/lirmm_api* /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
